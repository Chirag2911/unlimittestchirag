# HelloFresh Dev Team - Mobile Android Developer Test

The goal of this test is to assert (to some degree) your coding skills.

Feel free to add at any point any particular technique or algorithm that you think might enrich the overall quality of the end result. You're allowed and encouraged to use third party libraries, as long as you put them together yourself without relying on a framework to do it for you. An effective developer knows what to build and what to reuse, but also how his tools work. Be prepared to answer some questions about those packages.

If you can complete the test in 7 days it would be ideal. However, we'd like you to take your time and do it to the best of your availability so don't rush it :+1:

_Note: While we love open source here at HelloFresh, please do not create a public repo with your test in! This challenge is only shared with people interviewing, and for obvious reasons we'd like it to remain this way._

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Write your code, in various commits so we can see your development timeline. We won't be looking at the time each task took you. We're much more interested in your train of thought!
4. When finished, create a Pull Request.
5. Reply to the thread you're having with our HR department telling us that we may start reviewing your code.

## Exercise

Build an app in which:â€‹
* The content in the first screen is loaded dynamically from the [recipes.json](recipes.json) file.
* It has a login screen for signing in with a valid email and a password.
* Each recipe can be marked as favorite/unfavorite.
* Each recipe can be rated/unrated.
* Each recipe has an image.
* Each recipe can be seen in more detail. 

## Requirements

* Your app MUST be developed in Java.
* Your app MUST have API 16 as minSdkVersion.
* Since there's no server side component the server requests will fail. This is expected. However, client side validation before submitting forms MUST be implemented.
* You MUST implement a fluid layout, that adapts to most phones and tablets _dimensions_ and _orientation_.
* You MUST name all labels, variable names, and identifiers of any kind in English.
* You MUST document your code.
* You CANNOT use app development frameworks (like cordova or others). But again, feel free to use any third party libs that might save you time.
* You SHOULD write tests. Feel free to use Java or Kotlin for your tests.

Good luck, and have fun!
